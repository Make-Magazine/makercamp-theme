			<h1>About us</h1>

			<p>Maker Camp is designed to get more kids making more, and to support the adults who want to introduce the joy of
				making to a million makers. We aspire to become a community-built collection of project tutorials by, for, and
				with the kids who are making the world of the future.

			<h1>What is Maker Camp?</h1>

			<p>
				Maker Camp is a free, 6-week online (and in-person) summer camp for young Makers interested in DIY, making,
				creating, crafting, hacking, tinkering, and learning. It combines the best parts of summer camp and with sure-fire
				starter projects, so that young Makers across the country and the world can make together.</p>

			<p>Campers make projects,
				go on virtual field trips, and interact with our counselors wherever they are including: from home, on the road,
				or at local community spaces like public libraries, Boys and Girls Clubs, Computer Clubhouses, 4-H Clubs, scouting
				groups, and more. Past field trips have included virtual visits to NASA, Disney, LEGO, the White House, Blue Man
				Group, and Pixar.
			</p>

			<p>
				Maker Camp is produced by Maker Media, the people behind Maker Faire and Make: magazine.
